Code review notes

[x] Switch “distance” field on nodes to a “position” vector; this will
let us calculate distance in 3d space and stop worrying about system
membership for battles
[x] Use volume-units for all resource calculations, then divide by
cargovol right before showing the numbers to the player (shipinstances
make this problematic; discuss)
[x] Keep json file up-to-date
[x] Run program as part of regular testing
[ ] Have minimal and maximal test cases for various entities in json
[x] Remove obsolete features promptly to prevent confusion
[x] Use highly explicit variable names

GENERAL:
[x] Have a "bitmap" field on Nodes, which sets the bitmap to be used in other nodes' backgrounds to depict this node
[x] We can have suns as orphaned, linkless nodes for environment-bitmap purposes; this should be cheap -- have an "exclude from system" field on json nodes, so that a sun can be in a system but not linked to the other nodes. Also probably useful for other purposes. (Need to figure out the orphan checking)
[ ] Figure out the whole issue of whether and how we check for supply from input stockpiles (and demand from output stockpiles?).
[ ] Test whether stockpiles set to not propagate work the way they're supposed to.
[x] Replace the threat field on Node with the factions field on Global Salience.
[x] Figure out issues surrounding engine mechanics -- the relationship between once-per-turn events and once-per-move events
[x] A list of ship keys is stored in hangar.contents, but ships in a hangar have their location data set to the carrier holding them. This is redundant. We should probably abandon the notion of the contents field and stick to ship.location, but given that ships can have multiple hangars, we'll need a way to specify, which probably means unique hangar keys and hangars being stored in a table in root...
[x] When entities are stored in a table, we don't (AFAIK) have a way to get the key associated with an entity if all we have is the entity itself. This means that any time we need the entity's key for a method on an entity, it can't actually be a method -- it has to be an associated function. This seems non-ideal. (Associated functions are fine, per Amaryllis.) (Later mostly resolved by switch to Arcs.)
[x] We'll need to make a "get ideal strength" method on fleetclass, which likewise references a "get ideal strength" method on shipclass, so that we can do disbandthreshold checking properly without the modder having to calculate it manually. Or maybe keep the idealstrength field on fleetclass, but compute it at hydration.
[x] Add nodeflavor enterability checks
[x] Figure out how to handle some edges being traversable and not others by certain ships. Edgeflavors, probably.
[x] Battlescalars struct
[x] Engine health
[x] Battle check method (on root)
[x] maybe also make internal_battle a method on root?
[x] Add hangarclass as a field to hangarinstance, and id as a field to hangarclass, maybe same for repairers, etc.
[x] Have visibility defined in the class of things
[x] Maybe add visibility to more entity types (nodes? systems? factions?)
[ ] If we implement disband checking the easy way, more experienced fleets will effectively have lower disband thresholds than less experienced fleets. Is this fine?
[x] Split out force-gathering from internal_battle into a separate function that parcels out all the data needed by FSO (will this be viable in terms of expense?)
[x] Add per-turn/per-engagement toggle on repairers
[x] Have repairers check for damage before running
[x] Build navigation/traversal methods for fleets
[x] Add id field to entity instances; use this where relevant
[x] Base battle duration on strength calc with avg duration instead of shipcount
[x] Experience should probably work differently (it should be a feature of characters, not ships; basically dummy it out for now)
[x] Defectchance as from-faction and to-faction
[x] Build defection logic
[x] Implement shipflavors (and maybe fleetflavors?)
[ ] Implement variants for ships
[x] Config struct on root with settings for salience propagation iters
[x] Replace current implementation of entity locations with entity-component system or similar
[x] Build hangar entry and exit methods
[ ] Build balance_stockpiles
[ ] Build balance_hangars
[ ] Build operation logic
[x] Clean up salience propagation logic
[ ] Figure out the situation with generic unitclass demand.
[x] Figure out the whole thing with whether demand from a pluripotent stockpile should be divided by the number of relevant resources or whatever
[x] Think about whether there should be a check so that hangars don't generate demand for/seek out units that can't currently fit in them. (Not needed; demand is calculated based on ideal configurations)
[x] Create check in transfer to make sure units can't be inside themselves
[ ] Build out process_turn
[x] Gigantic refactor! Switch everything in root over to Arcs.
    [x] Convert nodeflavors.
    [x] Convert nodes.
    [x] Convert systems.
    [x] Convert edgeflavors.
    [x] Convert factions.
    [x] Convert resources.
    [x] Convert hangarclasses.
    [x] Convert engineclasses.
    [x] Convert repairerclasses.
    [x] Convert factoryclasses.
    [x] Convert shipyardclasses.
    [x] Convert shipais.
    [x] Convert shipclasses.
    [x] Convert shipinstances.
    [x] Convert fleetclasses.
    [x] Convert fleetinstances.
    [x] Convert engagements.
    [x] Deal with hangarinstances.
[x] Put certain methods in "mobility" trait on Arc-Ship/FleetInstance
[x] Put certain methods in "locality" trait on Arc-Node
[x] Make "mobility" fully generic -- allow fleets and hangars to hold fleets
[x] "Propagates" bool on factions, resources, shipclasses, fleetclasses; check for this and don't do salience prop calcs for things that don't have it as true
[x] Replace root's shipinstances and fleetinstances with units (decided not to do this for now)
[x] Build "unitclass"; replace shipclass salience with unitclass salience
[x] Refactor internal_battle and related to clean it up, take advantage of unit genericity, and allow multi-coalition engagements
[x] Make try_defect fully generic?
[x] Change squadron supply so that it gets the volume of the squadron as it actually exists, rather than ideal volume
[x] Interdictor stat on ships
[x] Rename "fleets" to "squadrons"
[ ] Build edge-length system
    [x] Add check_for_battles, balance_hangars, and balance_stockpiles bools on node
    [x] Build node templating system
[ ] Figure out mechanics for ground assaults/ship or station capture
    [ ] Flag for nodes that can only be captured via 'special missions', which have certain conditions -- "special capture requirements", Option<Mission>?
[ ] Add inter-node weapons
[x] Add navigation threshold on ships and fleets, and check for it in navigate
[ ] Excursions!
[x] Clean up hydration logic -- which things do or don't return just the internal struct vs. internal struct plus stringid.
[ ] Dessication logic
[ ] Rehydration logic
[ ] Optimize salience propagation logic
    [x] Exclude all-to-all system edges from propagation
    [ ] Store salience source node data so we can prune the logic for unit movement
    [ ] Move propagation logic to GPU

LONGER-TERM:
[ ] Build system for transmitting data to FSO
[ ] Build in-FSO display system for Spiderweb data
[ ] Hook Spiderweb into Project Alderaan

LOW-PRIORITY:
[ ] Have relations between factions in a coalition fighting together affect strength score
[ ] Allow factions that have no presence in the node where a battle is taking place to send reinforcements in if they want
[ ] Build system for ships deciding to leave squadron, and add squadron-misalignment-tolerance scalar to shipclass
[ ] Build high-level nonlocal fleet system
[ ] Build morale system
[ ] Build pilot system
[ ] Build intel system
[ ] Replace shipbuilding system with a more simulationistic one
[ ] Build parser to convert .blend file to Spiderweb nodemap

QUESTIONS FOR AMARYLLIS:
[x] process_engines short-circuiting
[x] retain for remove_dead and disband_fleets
[x] orphan checking/how does the all-to-all edge generation even work currently?
[ ] figure out what objective data structure should be
[ ] What's the best way to get the objective data for Engagement?
[x] What's the tradeoff between storing data in the classes table and having to look it up/storing the data in the instance and having it be redundant? (Copy cheap integers, etc., into instances, leave strings in classes.)
[x] Is there a more efficient way to handle the per-engine nodeflavor/edgeflavor checking than cloning the engine data and passing it up to traverse?
[x] Can we get rid of the clones in various places?
[x] Is the usize::MAX technique good design?
[x] Is there a better way to handle figuring out what ship a hangar belongs to while avoiding data duplication?
[x] Make sure table-index/key creation is adequately safe
[x] What the fuck do we do about the mutability/ownership bullshit w/r/t ship creation if we can't clone???
[x] How do we make an unwrap make the check fail instead of crashing when checking for forbidden edgeflavors between two nodes that don't have an edge (or if the thing is given two of the same node)?
[x] Doing "adding a specific thing to a collection we're getting from somewhere else" in a sane fashion
[x] Making the get_ai thing work correctly without creating overlapping ids
[x] Look over The System-Edge-Building Situation(TM)
[x] Figure out what to do about fleet ideal volume
[x] Probably there's a cleaner way to do the coalition wars gathering? (There isn't. Or at least Amaryllis didn't immediately come up with one.)
[x] How do we handle making sure the arcs get cleaned up properly when a dynamic entity is destroyed? (Just go clean up the arcs; weaks aren't necessary.)
[x] What's the best way to get the data about how many resources there are for get_resource_demand? (It probably works better to not even divide by number of resources the stockpile can hold.)
