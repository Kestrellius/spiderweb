Spiderweb is a highly parallel, highly extensible performance-critical distributed economics and warfare simulator written in pure memory-safe Rust. It rapidly processes nodegraphs of thousands of nodes, running complex economic and military logic to drive the behavior of the many agents that occupy the graph. The system is designed to flexibly adapt to a wide variety of use-cases.
